# Approximation-of-the-integral

## Introduction

Numerical integration is a fundamental technique in mathematics and computer science. It is used to estimate the value of a definite integral when an analytical solution is challenging or impossible to obtain. This repository provides simple Python scripts for implementing three common numerical integration methods: the Trapezoidal Rule, Rectangle Method, and Simpson's Rule.

## Methods

### 1. Trapezoidal Rule

The Trapezoidal Rule approximates the integral of a function by dividing the area under the curve into trapezoids. It is a straightforward method and provides a reasonably accurate estimate of the integral.

### 2. Rectangle Method

The Rectangle Method, also known as the Midpoint Rule, approximates the integral by dividing the area under the curve into rectangles. It uses the midpoint of each subinterval to estimate the height of the rectangle.

### 3. Simpson's Rule

Simpson's Rule provides a more accurate estimate of the integral by fitting a quadratic polynomial between adjacent data points. This method divides the area under the curve into a series of parabolic segments.
